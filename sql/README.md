# How to set up db sql

 <h1>For windows</h1>
- Turn on your apache and mysql 
    <h3>Note for xampp</h3>
    <p>(This works on xampp/mamp on Unix operating system e.g. mac, linux and window operating system or wsl which imports linux distro.) Due to xampp being installed on rpm certain distro may not support it like arch based linux such as arch/manjaro. Maybe there is a aur for xampp that you can pacman -S for it. There are definitely work arounds to this for arch and others alike. For ubuntu users like myself, no problemo!</p>
